## What is this and who is this for?
I love listening to audiobooks especially Nepali audiobooks and I searched online. The only option was an old WordPress site that used an inbuilt HTML audio component and it was hard to navigate. So I made this project for myself and for those who want to listen audiobooks online without having to download them first. Also, I added the option to download as well.

## What I learned
I learned a lot during this project. I struggled a lot to add lazy loading on the book cover images. After trying out a number of libraries, which didn't work on a carousel, I decided the best way to implement lazy loading for this project would be by simply adding a background-image CSS property. Also, I learned a lot by making my own music player using the audio API.

## What I would do if I had more time
Being an aspiring developer, I want to learn a plethora of things. So I am not able to give a lot of time to this project as much as I want. If I had more time I would add total number of hours each book has, book flip animation on homepage, and even a backend.
